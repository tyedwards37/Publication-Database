Project: Publication Database
by Tyler Edwards 
Added October 2023

Description: Create a database for storing different types of publications. The three publication options are Books, Journals, or EJournals. Once you have added publications to the database the user is then able to print its information to a file or delete it. With at least one publication in the database, the user is able to have the program list all the publications. When the user is done with any one action, it will bring them back to the selection menu. Once done entirely, they are able ot quit out, which will close the code. With its current implmentation the database is exclusive to that instance of the running code, so quitting will cause the user to lose the publications they have entered.

Language: Java

Reason: For CPSC 231 (Computer Science II)

Successes: Allowed me to utilize my skills in Java, after having taken a course in it fo high school.

Setbacks: Figuring out the scope of the inheritance between files was difficult at first.

Learned: how to use polymorphism, how to use inheritance
